Assignment 
Write a web page that enables the user to play the game of 15. There is a 4-by-4 board (implemented as an HTML table) for a total of 16 slots. One of the slots is empty. The other slots are occupied by 15 tiles, randomly numbered from 1 through 15. Any tile next to the currently empty slot can be moved into the currently empty slot by clicking on the tile.
Requirements 
1. Your program should create a board with the tiles out of order. The user’s goal is to arrange the tiles in sequential order row by row. Using the DOM and the onclick event, write a script that allows the user to swap the positions of the
open position and an adjacent tile. [Hint: The onclick event should be specified
for each table cell.] 
2. Your program should determine when the game is over, and then prompt the user to determine whether to play again.  If so, scramble the numbers using the Math.random method.
3. Your program should allow a user quit the current game and start a new game (create a “New Game” button for it). 
4. 4. Your program should allow a user create a simple game with only one tire out of position so that a user can solve the puzzle with one move (create a “Simple Game” button for it). 
5. 5. Your program should count the number of moves a user has already made in the current game. 
6. 6. Your program should record the amount of time a user has already spent on the current game. 
7. 7. Your program must work in both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. 
8. 8. Your program must be written in JavaScript.  You are not allowed to use any JavaScript library such as jQuery.
